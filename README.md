[Leipzig](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig)
============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ctford/leipzig.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ctford/leipzig)

A composition library for Clojure and Clojurescript by [@ctford](https://github.com/ctford).

Use
---
Include it as a dependency in your `project.clj`, along with [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone):

```clojure
[overtone "0.9.1"]
[leipzig "0.10.0"]
```

Leiningen template
------------------

There is a [Leiningen template](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig-template) that creates a simple Leipzig project,
ready to run.

Get started
-----------

Leipzig models music as a sequence of notes, each of which is a map. They are ordered by `:time`:

```clojure
[{:time 0
  :pitch 67
  :duration 2
  :part :melody}
 {:time 2
  :pitch 71
  :duration 2
  :part :melody}]
```

When using Leipzig, it's helpful to keep this model of notes in mind. Leipzig's functions are convenient
ways of manipulating this basic structure, but there's nothing to stop you from building your own.

You can create a melody with the `phrase` function. Here's a simple melody:

```clojure
(require '[leipzig.melody :refer [bpm is phrase then times where with tempo]])

(def melody
         ; Row,  row,  row   your  boat
  (phrase [3/3   3/3   2/3   1/3   3/3]
          [  0     0     0     1     2]))
```

The first argument to `phrase` is a sequence of durations. The second is a sequence of pitches. `phrase` builds a sequence of notes which we can transform with sequence functions, either from Leipzig or ones from Clojure's core libraries.

To play a melody, first define an arrangement. `play-note` is a multimethod that dispatches on the `:part` key of each note, so you can easily define an instrument responsible for playing notes of each part. Then, put the sequence of notes into a particular key and tempo and pass them along to `play`:

```clojure
(require '[overtone.live :as overtone]
         '[leipzig.live :as live]
         '[leipzig.scale :as scale])

(overtone/definst beep [freq 440 dur 1.0]
  (-> freq
      overtone/saw
      (* (overtone/env-gen (overtone/perc 0.05 dur) :action overtone/FREE))))

(defmethod live/play-note :default [{midi :pitch seconds :duration}]
  (-> midi overtone/midi->hz (beep seconds)))

(->>
  melody
  (tempo (bpm 90))
  (where :pitch (comp scale/C scale/major))
  live/play)
```

There's nothing magic about `where`. It just applies a function to a particular key of each note, like `update-in` for sequences.

Let's define two other parts to go with the original melody:

```clojure
(def reply "The second bar of the melody."
         ; Gent -ly  down the stream
  (phrase [2/3  1/3  2/3  1/3  6/3]
          [  2    1    2    3    4]))

(def bass "A bass part to accompany the melody."
  (->> (phrase [1  1 2]
               [0 -3 0])
       (all :part :bass)))

(defmethod live/play-note :bass [{midi :pitch}]
  ; Halving the frequency drops the note an octave.
  (-> midi overtone/midi->hz (/ 2) (beep 0.5)))
```

You can then put multiple series of notes together:

```clojure
(->>
  bass
  (then (with bass melody))
  (then (with bass melody reply))
  (then (times 2 bass))
  (tempo (bpm 90))
  (where :pitch (comp scale/C scale/major))
  live/play)
```

Namespaces
----------

Leipzig features a number of namespaces, each containing functions pertaining to a
particular area of composition.

### `leipzig.melody`

This namespace contains the core functions for creating and manipulating melodies. In particular:
- `phrase` creates a melody from a sequence of durations and a sequence of pitches.
- `where` applies a function to a specified key of each note in a melody.

For example:

```clojure
(->> (phrase [3/3 3/3 2/3 1/3 3/3] [0 0 0 1 2])
     (where :time inc))
```

### `leipzig.live`

Here are functions to send your melodies to Overtone:
- `play-note` is a multimethod that dispatches on the `:part` a note has.
- `play` plays the notes.
- `jam` loops the notes, reloading the var each time.
- `stop` stops all running melodies.

For example:

```clojure
(defmethod live/play-note :melody [{midi :pitch}]
  (some-> midi overtone/midi->hz beep))

(def boring-scale
  (->> (phrase (repeat 1) (range 8))
       (all :part :melody)
       (where :pitch (comp C major))))

(jam (var boring-scale))
```

    ; Edits to boring-scale will be played each time we go back round the loop.

### `leipzig.scale`

This namespace contains functions for placing melodies within musical scales. In particular:
- `major` and `minor` are functions that place a pitch within a relative scale.
- `A`, `B`, `C` etc are functions that take a relative pitch, and place it in a specific absolute key.

For example:

```clojure
(->> (phrase (repeat 1) (range 8))
     (where :pitch (comp C major)))
```

### `leipzig.chord`

The `phrase` function accepts chords as well as simple pitches. This namespace provides simple ways
to manipulate them:
- `triad` is the tonic, which can be manipulated to form other chords.
- `root` scales the chord up to the specified root.
- `inversion` inverts the chord, leaving the root where it is.

For example, a fourth chord, then the second inversion of the fifth:

```clojure
(phrase
  [4 4]
  [(-> triad (root 3))
   (-> triad (inversion 2) (root 4))])
```

### `leipzig.temperament`

This namespace translates midi pitches into frequencies. Overtone's `midi->hz` will usually do
just fine, but if you want to experiment with more exotic temperaments, there are plenty here.

In particular:
- `equal` is equivalent to `midi->hz` and translates frequencies into pitches like a piano is tuned.
- `just` uses pure ratios, and more closely models how singers interpret intervals into frequencies.

For example:

```clojure
(->> (phrase (repeat 1) (range 8))
     (where :pitch (comp just C major)))
```

Advanced use
------------

In addition to simple pitches, `phrase` can take maps representing chords or `nil`s:

```clojure
(require '[leipzig.chord :as chord])

(def chords "Off-beat chords."
  (->> (phrase (repeat 1/2)
               [nil chord/triad
                nil (-> chord/seventh (chord/root 4) (chord/inversion 1) (dissoc :v))
                nil chord/triad
                nil chord/triad])
       (all :part :chords)))
```

The maps generate a note for each value in the map - the keys are used only to enable chord-transforming functions such as `root` and `inversion`.

The `nil`s generate notes without pitches, representing rests. This is convenient, because it allows melodies to have a duration extending beyond their last audible note. However, the `play-note` implementations and `where` invocations must be prepared to handle this, e.g. by using `when` and `where`'s variation `wherever`:

```clojure
(require '[leipzig.melody :refer [wherever]]
         '[leipzig.scale :refer [lower]])

(defmethod live/play-note :chords [{midi :pitch}]
  (when midi (-> midi overtone/midi->hz beep)))

(->>
  (times 2 chords)
  (wherever :pitch, :pitch lower)
  (with (->> melody (then reply)))
  (tempo (bpm 90))
  (where :pitch (comp scale/C scale/major))
  live/play)
```

Clojurescript
-------------

Leipzig supports Clojurescript for all of its namespaces save `leipzig.live`. The `live` namespace depends directly on
Overtone, so it cannot be used in the browser. However the rest of Leipzig can be used so long as an alternative synthesis
engine is present like the Web Audio API. [Klangmeister](http://ctford.github.io/klangmeister/) is a good example of this.

Examples
--------

See [Row, row, row your boat](src/clj/leipzig/example/row_row_row_your_boat.clj) or
[whelmed](https://github.com/ctford/whelmed) for examples.

In [Leipzig from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp_kQh34EWA), I demonstrate how to create a piece from
`lein new` onwards.

Leipzig came out of a talk I gave called
[Functional Composition](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/music-functional-language), where I explain basic music
theory using Overtone and Clojure.

API

[API documentation](http://ctford.github.io/leipzig/), generated by [Codox](https://github.com/weavejester/codox).

Design
------

Leipzig is designed to play nicely with Clojure's standard sequence functions. Therefore, Leipzig's functions for transforming notes all take the sequence as a final argument so that they can be threaded with the `->>` macro:

```clojure
(->>
  (phrase (repeat 1) (cycle [0 2 4]))
  (take 24)
  (filter #(-> % :time even?)))
```

These sequence functions all exhibit "closure" i.e. their result is the same shape as their input. That allows them to be used and combined very flexibly. `where` for example, can raise the pitch, set the part or put the notes into a particular tempo:

```clojure
(->> notes (where :pitch inc))
(->> notes (where :time (bpm 90)))
```

Leipzig aims to be a library rather than a framework or environment. It uses simple Clojure datastructures and strives to be as open as possible. A new timing scheme, tuning or tempo can be mixed with Leipzig's other functions just as easily as the ones that come with the library.

Testing
-------

To run the unit tests without having to start Overtone's Supercollider server:

    lein midje leipzig.test.*

Issues
------

As pointed out by [@clojens](https://github.com/clojens), `leipzig.live` imports `overtone.live`, which implicitly boots an internal Supercollider server and [can cause problems for folks using 64 bit Windows](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig/issues/4).
